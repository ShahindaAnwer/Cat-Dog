# Cat-Dog Deep Learning Project

### Libraries

This project requires the following Python libraries installed:

- [Tensorflow - Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [The Ipython API](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/index.html)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Cv2](https://opencv.org/)


### Code

Code is provided in the `cat-dog` notebook file. Also included, are the dataset files. `Cat` and `Dog` are the data I used, but I also added the original 24,000 image dataset `PetImages (ALL)`


### Data

Data includes images of cats and dogs, which are used to train the CNN

The train set has ***x*** examples
The test set has ***y*** examples


**Results**
- `Cat` or `Dogs`
